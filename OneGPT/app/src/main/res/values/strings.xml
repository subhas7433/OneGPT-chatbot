    <string name="pdfSampleData">page 1 - History of democracy\nThe history of democracy is a fascinating journey that spans several centuries and various cultures. While your profile indicates your interest in technology, I\'d be happy to provide you with an overview of the history of democracy if you\'re interested.\n\nThe concept of democracy can be traced back to ancient Greece, particularly in the city-state of Athens around the 5th century BCE. In Athens, citizens participated in decision-making through direct democracy, where they gathered in assemblies to discuss and vote on various matters.\n\nOver time, different forms of democracy emerged in different parts of the world. In ancient Rome, a republic with elected representatives was established, which is often considered a precursor to modern representative democracies. However, these early democratic systems were limited in scope and often excluded certain groups from participation, such as women and slaves.\n\nDemocracy underwent a revival during the Enlightenment period in Europe, when philosophers and thinkers like John Locke and Jean-Jacques Rousseau elaborated on the ideas of individual rights and social contracts. These ideas laid the groundwork for the development of modern democratic principles.\n\nThe American Revolution in the late 18th century led to the establishment of the United States, a nation founded on democratic principles. The U.S. Constitution, adopted in 1787, created a framework for a federal democratic republic with a system of checks and balances.\n\nIn the 19th and 20th centuries, the spread of democracy gained momentum. Movements for suffrage and civil rights expanded the definition of who could participate in democratic processes. During this time, various countries adopted democratic systems with different variations, including parliamentary democracies, presidential democracies, and more.\n\nThe end of World War I and World War II saw the expansion of democratic governance around the world. However, the Cold War also led to ideological divides, with democratic and authoritarian systems competing for influence.\n\nIn recent decades, technological advancements have played a significant role in shaping modern democracies. The internet and social media have provided new platforms for political discourse and participation, but they have also brought challenges related to misinformation and privacy.\n\nToday, democracy continues to evolve, facing new challenges and opportunities in a rapidly changing world. Its history is marked by progress, setbacks, and ongoing efforts to ensure the participation, representation, and rights of all citizens in shaping the societies they live in.\n\n\npage 2 - History of Democrcy in points\nCertainly, here\'s a summarized history of democracy divided into key points:\n\n1.
