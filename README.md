# OneGPT

Welcome to the GitHub repository for OneGPT, an innovative Android app that brings the power of advanced AI models like GPT-4 and Claude 2 directly to your fingertips. With OneGPT, users can engage in dynamic conversations with AI, utilize AI tools for practical tasks such as writing emails or correcting grammar, generate AI art, and access premium features through a subscription model. This project showcases my development skills and is intended for portfolio purposes.

## Features

OneGPT is designed with user engagement and versatility in mind, featuring:

- **Login Screen**: Secure access to user accounts.
- **Chat Screen**: Interactive chat interface with GPT-4, Claude 2, and other AI models. Users can include PDFs or images as attachments.
